      <p>There’s a lot wrong with the world, and some of it seems like it’s impossible to fix. Businesses (and the marketing strategies they use) often make the list. But companies, large or small, don’t have to be part of the problem, nor do they have to be neutral. They, and the marketing they use to achieve their goals, can make the world better – and they should.</p>

            <h2>The Skinny</h2>
            <div class="clearfix">
             <h3>Here’s the problem.</h3>
              <p>Best Buy sells mostly media and electronics. People buy media and electronics in order to entertain themselves, to communicate with other people, and, in general, to make their lives more fun.</p>
              <blockquote>Why is it, then, that Best Buy has an image that’s the opposite of fun?</blockquote>
              <p>The company has a serious problem. Its customers no longer trust the way it does business and have lost faith in Best Buy’s desire to improve their lives. </p>
              <p>Best Buy used to be a source for electronics and media that had the advantage of both immediacy – products were there, on the shelf, to be looked at, touched, and bought without waiting for shipping and delivery – and customer service – there were staff members present to provide answers and suggestions about the complexities of modern media. It seemed like the experience didn’t matter as much as the availability of products. </p>
              <p>Times have changed, and Best Buy has failed to change with them. Best Buy’s customer service has acquired a reputation not only of laxity, but of exploitation. Many consumers feel that Best Buy’s staff, website, and stores actually make buying electronics and media more difficult. Best Buy also engages in selling practices that alienate the consumer, such as its promotion of insurance plans for electronics, and its unforgiving return policies. The buying experience has become gradually more unpleasant while simultaneously becoming more important to customers who are becoming more demanding. It’s not a good combination. In other words, Best Buy’s old core value, which has been to sell the most electronics and media, used to be enough to make it a successful company. That is no longer the case. </p>
              <h3>Here's how to fix it.</h3>
              <p>Best Buy needs to make its interactions with customers into more than transactions; these interactions need to become positive, even fulfilling, experiences. It can achieve this by redefining its core values. Instead of successful sales, the company needs to value customer service, community, and, above all, fun. </p>
              <blockquote>Instead of successful sales, the company needs to value customer service, community, and, above all, fun.</blockquote>
              <p>Customer service will help to set the company apart from other retailers, especially Amazon.com, which are the biggest threat to Best Buy’s business model, but more than that, it will create a positive experience that will make customers want to be part of its community. Best Buy stores and the website need to make consumers feel that they’re part of that larger community and that they have something to contribute to and something to gain from it. Best Buy can accomplish this by offering consumers resources and information they can’t get elsewhere, as part of a community experience, and in so doing make itself indispensible. Both customer service and community are part of the most appealing, and therefore, most important, of Best Buy’s new values – fun. It is, after all, the point of electronics and media. Somewhere along the line, Best Buy has forgotten that. If the company engages with the idea of improving people’s lives by making them more fun, and becomes fun itself – in stores, online, and in its corporate culture – it’ll show. More than that, Best Buy will actually succeed in making people’s lives more fun.</p>

            <div class="clearfix">

                <h3>Computer components display</h3>
                <p>Best Buy doesn’t currently carry components for building PCs, but it should.</p>
                <p>Not many other retailers are selling components in-store, so they’re hard to get quickly if customers want them. They also don’t appeal to lay computer users, but rather only to those who want to build their own computers. That said, Best Buy could easily leverage its current partnership with Dell to create modular, build-your-own computer displays at its stores.</p>
                <p>Imagine a white wall divided into cubes, each cube containing a motherboard, sticks of RAM, a graphics card, or some other component, and each with a clear, appealing label, reading something like, “Think faster,” “See clearer,” or “Remember more.”</p>
                <p>In order to appeal to as wide a base as possible, stores could offer pre-built but customizable computers as well as custom computer-building service and a la carte parts for immediate sale. In effect, Best Buy could create a Lego store for computer components, making them as appealing as toys to those who might not be comfortable with researching and purchasing them, and conveniently available to those who already see them as toys.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="maincol">
                <p>Customer service is an area where Best Buy needs to distinguish itself in order to stand out from other electronics retailers. Right now, while there are some resources for customers with complaints, and Best Buy is doing a decent job of addressing those complaints on Facebook and Twitter, the in-store experience is pretty bad. (I’m kind of big geek, so I’ve bought quite a few things from Best Buy, and I can’t say I thought much of the experience.) Salespeople seem disengaged and uninformed. The selection isn’t always particularly good. Corporate policy is to try to sell insurance plans for all big ticket items; most customers regard these insurance plans as little better than scams, and feel pressured to buy them when they have no interest in actually doing so. The level of customer service, which could be a huge asset to the store, is currently a shortcoming.</p>
                <blockquote class="oneline withsidebar">It’s not fun to shop at Best Buy.</blockquote>
                <p>Best Buy can create positive experiences for its customers by making customer service a core value. If Best Buy’s goal is to improve its customers’ lives, it’s going to have to make some changes in policies and training in order to market itself that way. Store employees should, of course, be trained about the products that they’re expected to sell, but they should also be given the chance to play and work with them, to actually use them, so that they know the ins and outs of the experience. By doing that, they’ll become not only informed and helpful, but honest evangelists for the products Best Buy sells. Return policies should be simple and extremely forgiving, so that Best Buy is, to the customer, a sympathetic and helpful figure. If something goes wrong, or the consumer didn’t like the product, Best Buy should play the role of friend, rather than authority. “Something’s gone wrong? We’ll make it right. Whatever it takes,” is the appropriate attitude. Finally, the company needs to change policies that make the consumer feel taken advantage of. Selling insurance on devices may not need to cease entirely, but it shouldn’t be adversarial or bullying, nor should salespeople be rewarded for making insurance sales. If all of these policies are incorporated into the business model, Best Buy will be a lot more fun. </p>

            <h2>Core Value: Community</h2>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <div class="sidebar">
                <h3>Affinity Pages</h3>
                <p>Let’s use “Best Buy Moms” as an example. Buying video games and electronics as gifts is notoriously difficult, especially when one is unfamiliar with the content, compatibility, and popularity of current games. Currently, if you’re a mom trying to figure out which version of a game you’re supposed to buy, you get exactly the same information as a dedicated gamer ordering a pre-release months in advance. The experience is neither helpful nor fun, and it actually makes buying something into a challenge.</p>
                <p>The “Best Buy Moms” site can offer its customers reviews from their peers that rate games for both age appropriate content and popularity with their own kids, explain the difference between ESRB game ratings, make suggestions about technical requirements, and answer specific questions about game systems and electronics.</p>
                <p>By becoming flexible and sensitive to consumer needs, Best Buy can make the experience of using its website not only positive, but valuable outside of the context of an actual purchase. It can provide a resource to consumers that will make it a home base for electronics and media discussion online. In can be, therefore, both informative and fun.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="maincol">
                <p>What does Best Buy have to offer the community of consumers? Largely, each other. The people who shop at Best Buy are part of distinct consumer groups that have a lot to offer the individuals that belong to them. Best Buy needs to create experiences and locations, both physical and digital, for each of those groups, that will help members of that group to share knowledge, affinities, and advice with each other. If Best Buy can become more than a store and a website, then it will create success for itself as a retailer by creating success for itself as a gathering place.</p>
                <p>Best Buy’s website will be the primary point of contact for a lot of its customers. Right now, the site is focused on the store first, and all other customer interaction later. There are currently support forums, a Twitter help page, and even a customer ideas suggestion board, but none of these is front and center, and each requires scrolling down to the bottom of the homepage, and at least one, if not more, clicks to access. In addition to that, the site is directed largely at people who are familiar with technology and the web. The site’s usability is poor, and there is no reason to visit the site aside from making a purchase or lodging a complaint. It’s not providing a positive experience; it’s barely providing an experience at all.</p>
                <p>The “Best Buy Community” site is treated as an afterthought, and, though Best Buy’s forums have quite a bit of traffic, much of it consists of complaints. The feel of the site is utilitarian and quite cold. The target audience, which should be every customer that has any kind of question, will have a hard time even finding the correct page or topic. Best Buy has a few blogs, but the updates consist largely of special offers and promotions, and lack authenticity. (The “Gaming News” blog, for example, has posts that feature upcoming sales and releases and some pretty canned self-promotion, but no substantive reviews or coverage of major industry events or news.)  The bottom line is that the Best Buy community page isn’t a community; it’s a collection of disgruntled customers and desperate-sounding salespeople arguing with one another. It’s definitely not fun.</p>
                <p>The first major change Best Buy should make is to rethink the goal of its community pages. Right now, these pages exist to do two things: sell products and mollify customers. Their goals, instead, should be to answer questions and to engage customers in useful dialogue. Hits shouldn’t come from people looking for resolutions to service problems; they should come from people who want to ask about the best games to buy for their kids’ birthdays, or about the relative merits of digital cameras for the amateur photographer. Some of that exists on the forums, but it’s only accessible to people who know exactly where to look. </p>
              </div>
              <blockquote>By shifting the website’s focus to its community, Best Buy can make its forums into a useful and even vital resource for electronics and media consumers.</blockquote>
              <p>As part of Best Buy’s new community initiative, its home page should offer visitors the option to choose the page that interests them the most. When a user arrives, he should see panes that offer choices between, for example, “Best Buy Moms,” “Best Buy Gamers,” “Best Buy Kids,” and whatever other consumer bases can be identified. (For usability’s sake, a prominent store link should also be visible.) This one small change, and the subsequent pages, targeted at specific interests, will make the store experience both pleasant and useful. The site will become fun.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>The value of community sites, of course, depends on engagement with the community. All of the affinity group pages described above will have to encourage participation. Best Buy has the advantage of its online store traffic to route customers to its community pages, but users need to be given incentives in order to become active and engaged participants. Best Buy currently runs a membership program called RewardZone, which gives frequent customers coupons and even money back. RewardZone should be incorporated into the new community pages, so that RewardZone dollars are offered for helpful, accurate, and interesting posts. Frequent posters who offer good advice or reviews (as determined by a user rating system) should also get badges added to their user icons that identify them as power users (silver and gold medals, for example). (These do currently exist on Best Buy’s forums (a tag that reads “super” is attached to the user’s name (there are no user icons – that’s another problem that can be easily corrected)), but they seem to be awarded mostly to employees of Best Buy.) Because BestBuy has a service department called Geek Squad, the company could even run a contest for frequent, helpful forum posters that had, as its prizes, actual jobs fixing problems. Best Buy might not love that idea, but it shows that the company both knows and values its users, as well as recognizing that those users sometimes have better solutions than the official ones. If community pages, especially those focused on troubleshooting, become a resource for a wide range of computer and electronics users, and those users feel like they’re valued and appreciated by Best Buy, they’ll reciprocate that appreciation.</p>

              <div class="sidebar">
                <h3>Best Buy store redesign:</h3>
                <p>Best Buy stores are currently, and aptly, classed as “big box” stores. They’re huge, high-ceilinged, and vaguely medical. They have industrial pipes and air ducts hanging from the corrugated ceiling, and they’re lit by drop floodlights. Blue, grey, and white are the dominant colors, and the floors are often concrete. Welcoming is not a word I’d use to describe the environment.</p>
                <p>Even by adding a few interesting displays, lowering the ceiling height, and laying down some colored carpeting, Best Buy could improve things a lot. I’m no interior designer, but I’m pretty sure warmth is a good idea.</p>
                <p>Giant octopus – also, not a bad plan.</p>

              <div class="maincol">
                <p>Once it’s addressed the more basic core values of customer service and community, Best Buy will have achieved its core value of fun simply by making the fundamental experience of purchasing electronics and media, and discussing those purchases, a fun experience. If every interaction with the company is fun, then the customer’s life is more fun because of Best Buy. That said, Best Buy can also work to make its customers’ lives more fun in a direct way by creating unique experiences for them. Best Buy should host game nights and game tournaments, allow players to post their scores, victories, and even gameplay video on the company’s own site as well as social media sites, and reward both participation and victory with prizes, promotional money, and recognition in the community pages.  Employees should be encouraged and provided time to play new games and use electronic devices so that they can engage with customers as fellow players in these tournaments and game nights. On high-traffic days like weekends and holidays, “Game challenge” areas should be set up where customers can compete with employees in multiplayer games.</p>

            <h2>Rebranding</h2>
            <div class="clearfix">
              <p>Best Buy is going to be faced with a challenge when it comes to presenting its new core values to its consumer base. Because of Best Buy’s current reputation, the company will have to successfully convince customers that their experiences in the past aren’t representative of what will happen in the future. In other words, it will have to convince its customers that it actually cares about them. It should, therefore, center its rebrand around a new tagline that’s representative of the huge change in its core values:</p>
              <blockquote class="oneline">“Make life more fun.”</blockquote>
              <p>Two of the new core values for the company (customer service and community) don’t lend themselves particularly well to direct marketing, and will be better communicated by both store experiences and social media. The third value (fun), however, is something that can be incorporated into advertising in order to make an immediate impression on consumers about how much the company has changed. If Best Buy is willing to do it, an apology may be the best way to introduce the rebranding effort. Television commercials and even an email campaign to current RewardZone members that apologize for Best Buy’s past mistakes and highlight its new ideas would be good places to start. The company should post apologies, incentive information, and upcoming community and store event promotions on its Facebook and Twitter pages, in order to get as much saturation as possible for its new message.</p>
              <h3>A possible email might read as follows:</h3>
              <div class="sample">
                <p>Dear customer:</p>
                <p>We have a confession to make. Somewhere along the way to becoming the biggest electronics and media retailer in the country, we lost something really important. (Don’t worry; it’s not your password or user information.) </p>
                <p>It’s not our selection. It’s not our great employees. It’s not our convenience. What we lost is…fun.</p>
                <p>We sell games. We sell electronics. We sell things that can make your life more fun. But it seems like, somehow, we forgot that that’s the most important thing we do.</p>
                <p>Well, we finally remembered, and we’re going to do something about it. Best Buy stores are going to become places where you can not only buy games, you can play games –  in tournaments, against employees, or just for fun. They’re also going to become places where you can talk to someone who really cares about your digital camera, your home entertainment system, or your phone – because they’ve got one, too. If something bad happens to a product you buy from us, we’ll find a way to make it right, without a huge hassle, because hassles aren’t fun. If you want something that we don’t have, we’ll find a way to get it for you, and we’ll ship it for free, because shipping charges aren’t fun either. </p>
                <p>Online, Best Buy’s going to become a place where you can meet and talk with other people like you – a community of customers who are interested in helping each other have more fun. Our new website will let you post reviews, videos, advice, and ideas that you can share with other people like you. If your posts help other people, you’ll earn rewards. Rewards are definitely fun.</p>
                <p>We’re redefining what Best Buy stands for, and we hope you like our ideas. Honestly, we hope you like fun. We do. </p>
                <p>Best Buy. Make life more fun.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br/>
                Best Buy staff</p>
              </div>
              <h3>How do you make life more fun?</h3>
              <p>In addition to email direct marketing and TV and print media, Best Buy should run a contest for user-created videos that celebrate the idea of making life fun.</p>
              <p>The company should develop an entirely separate site that focuses on getting users to make their own short films, centered on answering the question, “How do you make life more fun?” A short documentary, asking people on the street that question, would be an excellent introductory video for the site, and could be used as a TV ad, as well. The reward for the best video (or two or three) should be not only money or prizes, but also the use of the videos in nationwide commercials that will feature the new slogan, “Make life more fun.” </p>
              <p>Best Buy will also have to redesign its site, logo, and store displays to make their look more welcoming and, obviously, more fun. The blue-yellow-black-white, sharp, sans serif look that the company currently has is certainly recognizable, but by softening edges, changing fonts, and muting colors (or incorporating new color combinations), the company can make its customers feel its rebrand, not just hear about it. I’m not a designer, so I don’t have art for you, but a more casual style would go a long way toward making the website and store more welcoming and human.</p>
              <p>Best Buy should also incorporate its rebrand into a community service initiative. Doing so will show its customers that it isn’t making changes merely to make money; it’ll lend credence to the company’s reimagining of itself. There’s a large charity, Child’s Play, which was started by a video game-focused webcomic called Penny Arcade. (Did I mention I’m kind of a big geek?) The charity buys games and systems for hospitalized children to keep them entertained during their long illnesses. It currently boasts yearly donation totals of over three million dollars, as well as corporate sponsors such as Amazon.com, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony. Best Buy should be one of its sponsors (and match employee donations, too, in order to spread the idea of philanthropy throughout company culture). Community, fun, and customer service are pretty much at the center of what Child’s Play stands for, and, not only that, it’s also a way to connect directly to thousands of people who are interested in games. If Best Buy becomes a top-level Child’s Play sponsor, and especially if it breaks donation records, it will earn the respect and approval of a community almost guaranteed to be interested in its products. A direct marketing campaign that discusses Best Buy’s sponsorship of Child’s Play would publicize the company’s philanthropy and further improve its image. A simple explanation of what the charity stands for, played over footage of kids it’s helped, and followed by the slogan, “We make life more fun for kids. You can, too,” would be a good place to start. </p>

      <blockquote>Best Buy is one of the biggest retailers in the world. It has the potential to make millions of people’s lives better by making itself better. It has the potential, in other words, to become an enormous force for good. Its marketing can make that potential reality.</blockquote>

        <p>Claire Dawson has worked as a college admissions officer, deciding the fate of hundreds of eager young minds, and as a high school teacher, (hopefully) improving that fate. She’s also been a professional stage manager and theatre technician. (It’s hard to say whether actors or high school kids are a harder group to control.) She went to school for English literature and anthropology, and got a master’s in education, but has focused her laser-like attention on marketing and copy, since the desire to write and create just won’t leave her (and she has a secret love for advertising that’s actually a little maniacal). She enjoys making things <em>right</em>, whether it’s organizing schedules or finding the perfect description for something. The most important thing for her about any job is that she can learn something new there.</p>
