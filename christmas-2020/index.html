		<p>For countless years, humans have come together in the darkest hours of the year to kindle the light of fellowship.</p>
		<p>We eat and drink together, we give and receive together, we raise our voices together in song – because being together is what makes us human.</p>
		<p>We will not allow this year to take that away from us. </p>
		<p><em>We</em> decide what being together means. And whether we share our stories through a screen, or over a phone, or by ink and paper, our humanity remains undiminished.</p>
		<p>There’s no denying it’s been a hard year. But no matter how long the night, how far the distance, or how hard the road, the light of our fellowship shines bright against the darkness. </p>
		<p>It’s the light that will lead us home.</p>

			<p>All our love for a warm and joyful season.</p>
